# **App Name**: Amedeus Explorer

## Core Features:

- API Selection: Allow users to select from a list of the 40 Amadeus APIs.
- Request Builder: Construct API requests through a UI by inputting parameters (location, dates, etc.) to a web form. This web form acts as a tool.
- Data Mapping Tool: Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as a tool to map incoming data, ensuring alignment with front-end requirements.
- API Execution: Execute the selected Amadeus API call with user-specified parameters using the Amedeus API Key.
- Response Display: Display the raw JSON API response in a formatted and readable way.
- UI Preview: Render a simplified UI Preview based on the retrieved API data (flights, hotels, etc).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) for a professional, exploratory feel.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0), near the indigo hue.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF) for interactive elements.
- Body: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel. Should complement 'Inter' well for headlines.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different Amadeus API categories.
- Use a clear, tab-based layout to organize different API functions and display areas.
